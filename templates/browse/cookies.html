            <h3>What are cookies in computers?</h3>

            Also known as browser cookies or tracking cookies, cookies are small, often encrypted text files, located in
            browser directories. They are used by web developers to help users navigate their websites efficiently and
            perform certain functions. Due to their core role of enhancing/enabling usability or site processes,
            disabling
            cookies may prevent users from using certain websites.

            Cookies are created when a user's browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the
            browser which then creates a text file. Every time the user goes back to the same website, the browser
            retrieves
            and sends this file to the website's server. Computer Cookies are created not just by the website the user
            is
            browsing but also by other websites that run ads, widgets, or other elements on the page being loaded. These
            cookies regulate how the ads appear or how the widgets and other elements function on the page.

            <h3>Standard uses for browser cookies</h3>

            Website servers set cookies to help authenticate the user if the user logs in to a secure area of the
            website.
            Login information is stored in a cookie so the user can enter and leave the website without having to
            re-enter
            the same authentication information over and over.

            Session Cookies are also used by the server to store information about user page activities so users can
            easily
            pick up where they left off on the server's pages. By default, web pages really don't have any 'memory'.
            Cookies
            tell the server what pages to show the user so the user doesn't have to remember or start navigating the
            site
            all over again. Cookies act as a sort of “bookmark” within the site. Similarly, cookies can store ordering
            information needed to make shopping carts work instead of forcing the user to remember all the items the
            user
            put in the shopping cart.

            Persistent or tracking Cookies are also employed to store user preferences. Many websites allow the user to
            customize how information is presented through site layouts or themes. These changes make the site easier to
            navigate and/or lets user leave a part of the user's “personality” at the site.

            <h3>Cookie security and privacy issues</h3>

            Cookies are NOT viruses. Cookies use a plain text format. They are not compiled pieces of code so they
            cannot be
            executed nor are they self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and spread to other
            networks to execute and replicate again. Since they cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the
            standard virus definition.

            Cookies CAN be used for malicious purposes though. Since they store information about a user's browsing
            preferences and history, both on a specific site and browsing among several sites, cookies can be used to
            act as
            a form of spyware. Many anti-spyware products are well aware of this problem and routinely flag cookies as
            candidates for deletion after standard virus and/or spyware scans.

            The way responsible and ethical web developers deal with privacy issues caused by cookie tracking is by
            including clear descriptions of how cookies are deployed on their site. If you are a web developer and need
            advice on implementation of cookies and a privacy policy, we suggest you contact marketing specialists who
            offer
            search engine optimisation services. These privacy policies should explain what kind of information is
            collected
            and how the information is used. Organizations using the cookies initiative started by IAB Europe include:
            InviteMedia Networkadvertising.org : and Antor

            Most browsers have built in privacy settings that provide differing levels of cookie acceptance, expiration
            time, and disposal after a user has visited a particular site. Backing up your computer can give you the
            peace
            of mind that your files are safe.
